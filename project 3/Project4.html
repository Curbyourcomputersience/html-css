              <h2>An Overview of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)</h2>
              <p>HTML is a straightforward markup language that utilizes plain text with elements enclosed within < and > characters.</p>
              <p>The best part about HTML is that once we know how to effectively use basic elements, we can look up how to use all of the others!</p>

     <h2><U>Links</U></h2>
     <p>Links are very useful, and help users to quickly navigate to new pages, both within and outside of the current website.</p>
     <P>for instance they can quickly direct users to <a href=https://www.google.com/ target="_blank">Googles Homespace</a></P>
     <P><a href="mailto:info@example.com">Emails</a> can also be easily sent through the use of links.</P>
     <P><a href="https://hackertyper.com/">They can even bring user to a certain place within a webpage.</a></P>

    <h2><u>Images</u></h2>
    <p>Sometimes we want to go ahead and align pictures to the left of a line of text. Using the "align" attribute, with a value of "left" is a perfect way to do this. You could also align the picture to the right of text by replacing the value in the "align" attribute to "right*</p>
